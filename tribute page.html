<h4>
<p>Bhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Sikh family on 27 September 1907[1] in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan;
he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.
Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, 
taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.</p>
<p>
In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership,
and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it.
Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai,
who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom,
the British Government denied any role in Rai's death. </p>
